STRENGTHS
- Knowledge of each others strengths
- Mechanical engineering background
- Programming knowledge
- Good math skills
- Hardworking students

WEAKNESSES
- Similar backgrounds
- Little practical experience
- No machine vision experience

OPPORTUNITIES
- Real-life application
- Multiple ways to reach goals
- ABB factory visitation possibilities?

THREATHS
- Spending too much time evaluating different scenarios
	- (time allocation)
- Dependency on school resources
- Possibility of this project not being useful in real-life
	- too slow compared to manual workers (bottlenecking production)
- Picking the object in right orientation is crucial
- If this problem was trivial, ABB would have implemented it already.
